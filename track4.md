## Motivation
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="/assets/img/myops.png" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true caption="**Figure 1.** Myocardial pathology segmentation and its challenges. **(A) Myocardial Pathology Segmentation**: Scar and edema regions are marked in green and yellow, respectively. **(B) Challenges of Myocardial Pathology Segmentation**: The challenges include multi-center data, missing sequences, and misalignments in multi-sequence CMR images." %}

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Assessment of myocardial viability is essential in the diagnosis and treatment management of MI patients <d-cite key="myops1"></d-cite>. Multi-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance (MS-CMR) images can provide valuable myocardial pathology information, which is important for the diagnosis and treatment management of patients. As shown in Figure 1 (A), balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine sequences present clear anatomical boundaries, while late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted (T2) CMR sequences visualize myocardial scar and edema of MI, respectively.

## Track Description

The target of this track is to segment myocardial pathology regions, specifically scar and edema, from multi-sequence CMR data. This track seeks innovative solutions to address MyoPS using real-world multi-sequence CMR data. We encourage participants to overcome challenges such as the inclusion of multi-center data, missing sequences for some centers <d-cite key="myops2"></d-cite>, and misalignments in multi-sequence CMRs <d-cite key="myops3"></d-cite>, as illustrated in Figure 1 (B).


## Data Provision

This track will provide data of 250 patients across 7 centers from China, France, and the United Kingdom. The number of CMR sequence among the patients is as follows:

- **145 patients** have three CMR sequences: LGE, T2, and bSSFP.
- **24 patients** have two sequences: bSSFP and LGE.
- **81 patients** have only one sequence: LGE.

The LGE and T2 CMR sequences are respectively delineated with:
- **Scar** (2221)
- **Edema** (1220)

Additionally, we also provide labels for:
- **Left ventricle** (500)
- **Right ventricle** (600)
- **Healthy myocardium** (200)

All clinical data have received institutional ethical approval and have been anonymized to ensure privacy and compliance with ethical standards. Please [join this track](http://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/eval/register?track=MyoPS%2B%2B) to get access to this dataset.

## Data Split

The dataset is divided into three main parts: training, validation, and test sets:

- **Training Set**: All patients from Centers A, B, C, E, F, and G.
- **Validation Set**: 25 patients from Center D.
- **Test Set**: 25 patients from Center D.

### Pre-Processing

In this track, LGE and T2 images are derived from the end-diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. We have therefore extracted the end-diastolic phase of bSSFP (C0) for this track. 
Note that LGE, T2, and C0 are initially unaligned. The data published here come in two versions: one version has been pre-aligned using the [MvMM method](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/zxhproj), and another one has remained unaligned. **The test phase will be based on the version that has been aligned with the MvMM method.**

### Data Format
Each CMR sequence for patients will be provided in the NIfTI format as follows:
- [Patient Identifier]_LGE.nii.gz
- [Patient Identifier]_T2.nii.gz
- [Patient Identifier]_C0.nii.gz
- [Patient Identifier]_gd.nii.gz (gold standard label)

## Metrics and Ranking

### Metrics

The performance of scar and edema segmentation results will be evaluated byï¼š
- **Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)**
- **Accuracy (ACC)**
- **Sensitivity (SEN)**

Note that the track will provide an open platform for research groups to [validate](http://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/eval/scoreboard?track=MyoPS%2B%2B) and [test](http://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/test_submission) their methods. For fair comparison, the test dataset will remain unseen. Participants need to submit their [docker models](http://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/docker_tutorial) to our platform for testing.

### Ranking

The best work, following the precedent of [MyoPS 2020](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/myops20/), will be recognized with awards. A work is assessed based on several key criteria:

- **Test Results**: The performance of the methods as demonstrated by the test outcomes.
- **Novelty of Methodologies**: The originality and **generalizability** in the proposed methods.
- **Quality of the Manuscript**: The clarity, organization, and correctness of the written submission.
- **Presentation of Their Paper**: The effectiveness of the oral or poster presentation in conveying the work.


## Rules

- **Only automatic methods are acceptable.** Participants must utilize algorithms that do not require manual intervention or human-assisted processes for the segmentation task.
- **External data sets and pre-trained models are not allowed in this track.** The solutions must be developed using only the data provided within the scope of this track and cannot leverage any external datasets or models for assistance.

## Publication
The selected papers will be published in our proceedings [see previous proceedings](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-65651-5). Topics may cover (not exclusively):
- Myocardial Pathology Segmentation
- Cardiac Anatomy Segmentation
- Multi-Sequence Image Registration
